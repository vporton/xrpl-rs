# xrpl_async-rs

_(This project is not ready yet.)_

This is fully asynchronous XRPL client written in idiomatic Rust.

By fully asynchronous, I mean:
- Single async call not only for JsonRpcApi to receive the result of the call, but also single async call to WebSocketApi to receive the result of the call.
- Multipage answers (with "marker") are single asynchronous stream.

Example:
```rust
let request = ChannelsRequest {
    account: Address::decode("r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59"),
    destination_account: None,
    ledger: Ledger::Validated,
    limit: None,   
};
let (response, mut paginator) = account_channels(&api, &request)?;
// Now `response` contains data from response.
// Now `paginator` is a stream that is able to traverse multiple pages.
```

Paginator is implemented using futures and streams.

Internally, `ChannelsRequest` is a type that is convertible to
`Request`. `Request` can be passed to `Api` trait method `call`, that
returns `Response` that is convertible to `ChannelsResponse`. And
similarly for other API methods.

Two implementations of `Api` method are provided:
* `JsonRpcApi`
* `WebSocketApi`

I use `serde` for JSON (de)serialization.

The transactions binary serialization is done using code that is
autogenerated using a `derive` macros from transaction structs and
`definitions.json` file.

Transactions are done as follows (yet untested):
```rust
    let tx = PaymentTransaction {
        amount: Amount {
            value: 10.0,
            currency: "XRP".to_string(),
            issuer: our_address.clone(),
        },
        destination: our_address,
        destination_tag: None,
        invoice_id: None,
        send_max: None,
        deliver_min: None,
        signature: None,
        public_key: None,
    };
    sign_and_submit(&api,
                    tx,
                    public_key,
                    our_secret,
                    true).await?;
```
